1. Why not Docker for managing Containers?

In Docker we have to manually deploy and manage containers but K8s does self deployment and self healing.
K8s provides better Scaling.
K8s maintains desired state always.
K8s does good load balancing and it distributes traffic.

K8s is an orchestration tool allowing us to run and manage our container based workload.
