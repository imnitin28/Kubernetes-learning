Pods which are created directly by kubelet and not managed by api-server.
Although once created it can be seen by api-server just as a mirror object but can't be managed.

kubeadm actually uses static-pod to deploy K8s control plane. That is because kubeadm is setting up the
cluster and api-server is not available to it. That's why it deploys all k8s control plane as static pod.

All static pods can be found at 
minikube ssh
docker@minikube:/etc/kubernetes/manifests
etcd.yaml  kube-apiserver.yaml   kube-scheduler.yaml
kube-controller-manager.yaml

Above are main control plane objects.

-- How to deploy our Static pod.

kubectl run nginx --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml
--copy the yaml
minikube ssh
cd /etc/kubernetes/manifests/
sudo touch static-nginx.yml
chmod 777 static-nginx.yml
vi static-nginx.yml 
--paste the nginx copied yaml
