ENV Variables : 
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EnvironmentVariables

Environment variables provide a way to influence the behaviour of software on the system.
For example, the "LANG" environment variable determines the language in which software programs
communicate with the user. 

e.g:
EDITOR=nano
export EDITOR

printenv

ls $HOME/Desktop
- to list content of Desktop

## Working principles of environment variables

- Process locality

The values of environment variables are local, which means they are specific to the running 
process in or for which they were set. This means that if we open two terminal windows 
(which means we have two separate bash processes running), and change a value of an environment 
variable in one of the windows, that change will not be seen by the shell in the other window 
or any other program currently on the desktop. 

- Inheritance

When a parent process creates a child process, for example when we run the "gedit" command from 
the terminal and "bash" (the parent process) creates "gedit" (the child process), the child process
inherits all the environment variables and values the parent process had. 

- Case sensitivity

The names of environment variables are case sensitive. This means that lang is not the same variable as LANG, Lang, or laNg.
It is a common practice to name all environment variables with only English capital letters and underscore (_) signs. 

List ENV variables : 

$ printenv //displays all the global ENVs
or
$ set //display all the ENVs(global as well as local)
or
$ env //display all the global ENVs

Following steps can be followed to do so:
Step 1: Open the terminal.
Step 2:

$ sudo -H vi /etc/environment
* -H to set HOME variable to target user's home dir

Step 3:Enter password.
Step 4:Add variable in the file opened.

NAME=Value

Step 5: Save and close the file.
Step 6: Logout and Login again.
